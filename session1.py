# first program
# Calculate area of circle
# Area = Ï€r2
# Area of circle = pie*radius**2

pie = 3.1415
diam = 14
radi = diam/2

input pie value
input radius value
Calculate area by:
 pie times r square
dfisplay area of circle

input miles value
input name of the user
convert kms into miles by:
 miles is 1.6 * kms
display kms with name


# Write a program to input age of user and let them know if they have diabetes 
# risk or not. use case is that a user with age more than 65 is risky else not
# risky
age = 65
if age>= 65
  print("This is risky")
else
 print("not risky")
